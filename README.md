PICS: Pathway-Guided Identification of Cancer Subgroups
===

PICS is a statistical approach to improve prediction of cancer subgroups and identification of key genes and pathways by integrating information from biological pathway databases.

Installation
===========

To install the development version of PICS, it's easiest to use the 'devtools' package.

```
#install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("dongjunchung/PICS")
```

Usage
===========

The R package vignette will provide a good start point for the genetic analysis using PICS package, including the overview of PICS package and the example command lines:

```
library(PICS)
vignette("PICS-example")
```
The following two help pages will also provide quick references for PICS package and the example command lines:

```
package?PICS
class?PICS
```
