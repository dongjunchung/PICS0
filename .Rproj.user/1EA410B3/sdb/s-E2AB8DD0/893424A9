PICS stands for ``Pathway-guided Identification of Cancer Subtypes''.\nThe \\texttt{PICS} methodology for Pathway-Guided Identification of Cancer Subtypesis developed in \\texttt{PICS}. The proposed approach improves identification of molecularly-defined subgroups of cancer patients by utilizing information from pathway databases in the following four aspects.\n\n(1) integration of genomic data at the pathway-level improves robustness and stability in identification of cancer subgroups and driver molecular features; and\n\n(2) summarizing multiple genes and genomic platforms at the pathway-level can potentially improve statistical power to identify important driver pathways because moderate signals in multiple genes can be aggregated; and\n\n(3) in \\texttt{PICS}, we consider this ``operation'' or ``interaction'' between pathways, instead assuming that each pathway operates independently during the cancer progression, which may be unrealistic; and\n\n(4) \\texttt{PICS} allows simultaneous inference in multiple biological layers (pathway clusters, pathways, and genes) within a statistically rigorous and unified framework without any additional laborious downstream analysis.\n\nThe package can be loaded with the command:\n\n<<preliminaries,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=\noptions(prompt = \"R> \")\n@\n\n<<spls-prelim,results=hide>>=\nlibrary(\"PICS\")\n@\n\n\\section{Input Data}\n\nThe package requires that the response consist of 4 components:\n(1) z-scores in the form of a either dataframe or matrix; and\n(2) time and status variable for Cox model of survival analysis in the form of vectors; and\n(3) pathway information is in the form of a list where gene names are included in pathway lists respectively.\n\nThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is an example application for the `\\texttt{PICS}' package.\nThe TCGA data was downloaded from the cBio Portal (http://www.cbioportal.org/) using the R package CGDS, and we used z scores for the mRNA expression data.\n\nAll the mRNA expression measures were centered and scaled to have unit variance according to standard practice. Only genes annotated in the KEGG database and that appeared in both datasets were considered for analysis.In the current stage, we focused only on gene expression measurements and aim at incorporating other data types into our model in the future.\n\nZ scores for the mRNA expression data of 389 genes is given, also survival time and survival status of 50 observations are given in the form of numeric vector and binary vector respectively.\nA list of 4 pathways information can be found that consist of gene names.\n\nThe `\\texttt{TCGA}' dataframe as z scores for the mRNA expression, the `\\texttt{t}' vector as the survival time,\nthe `\\texttt{d}' vector as the survival status, and the `\\texttt{path.list}' list of the\npathways is loaded as follows:\n\n<<spls-data>>=\ndata(TCGA)\nTCGA[1:5,1:5]\nt[1:5]\nd[1:5]\npath.list[1]\n@\n\n\\section{Pre-filtering}\n\nWe expected that only a parsimonious set of genes would be related to patient survival, i.e., the sparsity assumption. To eliminate the most unlikely predictors, we first conducted a supervised pre-filtering by fitting a Cox regression model of each mRNA expression measure on patient survival in the TCGA dataset. Only the gene expressions associated with patient survival at p-values smaller than a pre-specified cut-off were included in the subsequent analysis. Here we chose p = 0.5 as the default cut-off point.\n\n<<prefilter-fn>>=\ntrain.list=prefilter(data=TCGA, time=t, status=d, p.cut=0.5, plist=path.list)\n@\n\n\\section{Gene Selection}\nThis section is about Gene-level Analysis using a SPLS\\cite{SPLS} Cox regression. In order to select key genes associated with patient survivals and effectively summarize them by taking into account correlation among them, we fit a sparse partial least squares (SPLS) Cox regression model of patient survivals on gene expression measurements for each pathway.\n\n\\texttt{PICS} utilizes extention of SPLS Cox regression so that it can handle survival outcomes, where there are two main tuning parameters: `\\texttt{eta}' represents\nthe sparsity tuning parameter and `\\texttt{K}'\nis the number of hidden (latent) components. Parameters can be chosen by ($v$-fold)\ncross-validation using the\nfunction `\\texttt{selectGene}'.  The user specifies the range for these parameters and\nthe cross-validation procedure\nsearches within these ranges. `\\texttt{eta}' should have a value between 0 and 1. `\\texttt{K}'\nis integer valued and can range between\n1 and $ min \\left\\{ p, (v-1) n / v \\right\\} $, where $p$ is the number of predictors and $n$ is the sample size. For example, if 10-fold cross-validation is used (default), `\\texttt{K}' should be smaller than $ min \\left\\{ p, 0.9 n \\right\\} $. For the TCGA data, we search for `\\texttt{K}' between 3 and 5 and for `\\texttt{eta}' between 0.1 and 0.9\nwith the following command:\n\n\n<<selectGene-fn,results=hide>>=\ngene.results=selectGene( data=train.list, fold=5, K=c(3,5), etas=c(0.1,0.9),seed=123)\n@\n\nThe function `\\texttt{selectGene}' returns the following output:\n\n(1) Gene: cancer related genes selected by our approach.\n\n(2) Gene beta: the SPLS regression coefficients of cancer related genes.\n\n(3) W: the direction vectors for constructing scores, where score = x*w, where x is the original gene expression data.\n\n(4) Score: the latent variables summarizing the gene expression data in each pathway, scores are linear combinations of the original gene expression data.\n\n\n\n\\section{Pathway Selection}\n\nNext, in order to identify a parsimonious set of pathways associated with patient survivals, we fit a LASSO-penalized\\cite{LASSO} Cox regression on latent components derived from all the pathways.\nFirst, the latent components generated from the SPLS step preserve pathway structure and also reflect correlation among genes and their association with survival outcomes. Second, this approach can potentially improve the stability of estimation in the subsequent analysis.\n<<selectPath-fn>>=\npath.results=selectPath( gene.results, seed=123)\nprintPathResults(path.results)\n@\nThe function `\\texttt{printPathResults}' returns the following output:\n\n(1) path.before: pathways that were left from pre-filtering step.\n\n(2) path.after: cancer related pathways selected by our approach.\n\n(3) Gene beta: the SPLS regression coefficients of cancer related genes.\n\n\n\\section{Pathway Effect Plot}\nIn the LASSO step, we could identify the pathways associated with patient survivals using the latent components generated from the SPLS step.\n\nSpecifically, a pathway was selected if at least one of its latent components had non-zero LASSO coefficient estimate. Figure 1 shows the hazard ratio (HR) associated with each latent component in selected pathways.\n\nBased on the TCGA data, pathways with the largest effect on survival (HR â‰¥ 1.15) are \\texttt{CITRATE\\_CYCLE\\_TCA\\_CYCLE} and \\texttt{MARK\\_SIGNALING} pathways.\n\n<<plot1,eval=FALSE>>=\nplotPathwayEffect(path.results=path.results)\n@\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbh]\n\\begin{center}\n<<plot1,fig=TRUE,height=6,width=6,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=\n<<plot1>>\n@\n\\caption{Hazard ratio (HR) associated with each latent component in selected pathways}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\section{Prediction}\nSurvival predictions were made based on model parameters estimated from the TCGA data.\n\n<<prediction-fn>>=\npredicted=pred( path.results, newx=train.list, n=50)\npredicted[1:3]\n@\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Survival Curve}\nThe predictive performance of \\texttt{PICS} method was presented by Kaplan-Meier curves.\n`\\texttt{survivalCurve}' returns Kaplan-Meier curves of predicted patient subgroups based on the \\texttt{PICS} approach.\n\n<<survivalCurve-fn>>=\nsummary( coxph(Surv(predicted$time, predicted$status) ~ predicted$riskcat) )\n@\n\n<<plot2,eval=FALSE>>=\nsurvivalCurve(predicted)\n@\n\nFigure 2 shows the Kaplan-Meier curves of predicted patient subgroups based on the \\texttt{PICS} approach. The \\texttt{PICS} approach could distinguish the high risk group from the medium risk (log rank test, p=0.0075) and low risk (log rank test, p=0.00005) groups.\n% but could not distinguish the medium risk group from the low risk group (log rank test, p=0.850).\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbh]\n\\begin{center}\n<<plot,fig=TRUE,height=6,width=6,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=\n<<plot2>>\n@\n\\caption{The observed survival curves for patient subgroups identified by the \\texttt{PICS}}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Survival ROC}\n\nThe predictive performance of \\texttt{PICS} method was further evaluated based on area under the time dependent receiver operating curve (ROC).\n`\\texttt{survivalROC}' returns a ROC for survival plot.\n<<plot2,eval=FALSE>>=\nsurvivalRoc(predicted)\n@\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbh]\n\\begin{center}\n<<plot2,fig=TRUE,height=6,width=6,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=\n<<plot2>>\n@\n\\caption{Time dependent Receiver Operating Curves}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigure 3 shows the ROC curves for survival and demonstrates an advantage of the \\texttt{PICS} approachs. For the TCGA data, the area under curve (AUC) associated with the \\texttt{PICS} approach was 0.964.\n\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\\bibitem{PICS} Wei Wei, Zequn Sun, Willian da Silveira, Zhenning Yu, Andrew Lawson, Gary Hardiman, Linda Kelemen, Dongjun Chung (2017), ``PICS: Pathway-guided identification of cancer subtypes''.
